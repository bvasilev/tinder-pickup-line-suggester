# Tinder pickup line suggester
A web interface that suggests the best pickup line based on the person's profile images and bio.

It uses posts from r/Tinder as training data, analyses their text using Microsoft's Cognitive Services API and produces a list of the best pickup lines for the context.

This is a project for Oxford Hack 2018 by Team XY\|\'\/\|.
